<p>As far as I am concerned I have completed my primary and secondary school education in Patna and I must confess that if you are guided well you might end onto the best facilities available at your doorsteps.  So was my case when I entered St. Karen's Nursery School being a tiny tot and completed my studies till IV th grade. Then I moved to <a href="http://stkarens.co.in/">St.Karen's High School </a> where I had completed my studies till Xth grade with ICSE Board. Being a part of this school had been one of the best parts in my life. I am glad to be a part of the long-lasting memories that I share with my friends and teachers  at school. <br><br> </p>

<p> Then came the most crucial part of my life, standard XI and XIIth. Since my childhood as I was little inclined towards science and technology which not just facinated me but even puzzled me at times, so I aspired to be an IITian as in India you may not find a better institute than the old IITs to learn and explore. We can never know the best you may get unless you take an effort to find it. So was the case with me. <br><br></p>

<p> I decided to stay in Patna itself and prepare for the same. But  the first month of my stay had changed my life. Earlier I had opted for a flying course, which in layman's language is no school for the next two years. But as the days passed by I well understood that was not what could suit me and now in most of the schools studies had already begun. Though I took the decision instantly I was very well supported by my parents and got admitted in <a href="http://www.stmichaelspatna.edu.in/">St. Michael's High School </a> (aff. CBSE Board), one of the other best schools you might love to be a part of. Besided this I joined <a href="http://mentorsedu.com/">Mentors Eduserv</a> , the coaching centre for preparing students for JEE. This combination had really worked very well with me and I cleared JEE and even scored a good percentage of 94.6% and now here I am at the oldest Indian Institute of Technology , Kharagpur which I had dreamt of. <br><br></p>
<p> Well being in college is yet another world and I hope to make the best use of the facilities being provided to me.<br><br><br><br>
