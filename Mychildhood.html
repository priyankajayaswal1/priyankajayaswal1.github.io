<p style="color: blue; font-family:bookman;">  I was welcomed on the 1st of November on this earth as the first child to my parents. My father, <strong style="color:#003366">Mr. Pradeep Kumar Jayaswal </strong> is a stock investor and presently Sales Manager at<strong style="color:#003366"> Prism bank</strong>. My mother <strong style="color:#003366">Mrs. Abhiniti Jayaswal </strong>is a very versatile personality as she has always been my source of inspiration since I got sense. She is a housewife but I at times don't understand how she has an immediate and most efficient solution to any trouble that tries to haunt us. I aspire to be a lady of this vigour and yup she is my real role model. I have a younger brother too, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rishabh.jayaswal.9"><strong style="color:#003366">Rishabh Jayaswal.</strong> </a>He is actually my secret keeper and saviour (so am I for him, as we share a unique unwritten agreement to save each other from the anger of papa or mummy as times you may understand) .<br><br>
</p>
<p style="color: blue;font-family:bookman">Well as we know that childhood is the most integral part of a person's life and for me been born in <a href="http://www.holidayiq.com/Patna-Sightseeing-505.html" ><strong style="color:#003366"> Patna</strong></a> has been a great and different experience. I have not just enjoyed the diversity in climate but have loved to see the unity that is imbibed in the diverse culture The charm the city is dipped in can be best viewed at the time of Chatt puja in which we worship the Sun for showing our gratitude to the God Sun for showering His blessings.<br><br>
<p style="color: blue;font-family:bookman" >
As far as what my mother and relatives say I had been the most mature child they had seen. ( B| ) . StilI it doesn't mean I wasn't naughty as I had been often caught in executing mischevious errands being the leader at times. (:P still being regarded mature really confuses me at times.) Well I was amazed by whatever was going around and loved to debate on finding a solution to any issue which somehow caught the attention of a tiny girl like me then. This made me conclude often that I wanted to pursue any profession I have witneesed making it clear that I wanted to be a doctor, an engineer, a judge , a police and what not. ( quite funny though).  </p>
<p style="color: blue; font-family:bookman">The faint memories which I'm able to concile or hear from people around me makes we conclude that yes me too had an awesome childhood. :) <br><br><br><br></p>
